We seek to appoint a candidate with a background in machine learning or closely related discipline.  Machine intelligence is already used in many applications that, while not explicitly morally-loaded, have clear and profound social implications, from facial recognition, to the distribution of online attention. It is also used to support decisions that have explicit moral dimensions, for example about how to allocate welfare resources, and whom to grant bail or parole. And the application of MI in fully autonomous decision-making systems (robotic and otherwise) is accelerating. Self-driving vehicles, autonomous weapons systems, and companion robots are the first wave of such systems; many more are on the way. Many companies and governments are heavily invested in developing more general, multipurpose forms of MI. All of these autonomous systems will need to be able to make morally-loaded decisions by themselves.  In each of these fields inadequate attention to ethics in the design of MI systems will predictably have negative social consequences, some of which could be catastrophic. The goal of the HMI project is to forestall those risks, and help to realise the tremendous social benefits promised by MI. The project has three components: (1) Discovery: formulate the design problem by identifying the social risks and opportunities of widespread reliance on MI. (2) Foundations: identify and answer the fundamental theoretical questions on which progress towards ethical MI depends. (3) Design: develop ethical algorithms and broader MI systems in partnership with industry and government.  The HMI project chief investigators are: Associate Professors Seth Lazar (Project Leader), Colin Klein and Katie Steele (Philosophy), Professors Marcus Hutter, Sylvie Thiébaux, Bob Williamson and Lexing Xie (Computer Science), Dr. Jenny Davis (Sociology), and Professor Toni Erskine (Political Science). We have already appointed 6 postdoctoral researchers in a range of areas relevant to the project, and are now looking for someone with a machine learning or related background interested in the ethical dimensions of this technology.  Our primary criterion for this position is demonstrated research excellence and the clear potential to be research leaders in the field of moral MI with a particular focus on machine learning. Successful applicants will also be ready and equipped to engage with scholars from other disciplines and are expected to work actively with scholars from at least two of the project’s discipline areas.  The successful applicant will help us design the next generation of more ethical MI systems, in part through publishing internationally influential research in the leading peer-reviewed venues (as suited to their discipline). We expect them to become leaders in academia, industry or government. As well as conducting research at the highest level, they will help build the HMI community at ANU and globally, through convening a regular seminar series and international workshops. They will also contribute, at a reduced intensity, to the education and outreach agendas of the School, in a manner appropriate to the level of appointment.  The position is available at academic Level B (Research Fellow) or C (Senior Fellow) and is for a duration of 4 years. For candidates who currently hold tenure-track or permanent appointments at universities, industry or government and in other exceptional circumstances, a tenure-track or continuing appointment may be considered.  The ANU provides attractive benefits and excellent support to maintain a healthy work/life balance and offers generous remuneration benefits, including four weeks paid vacation per year, assistance with relocation expenses and 17% employer contribution to superannuation. This also includes generous parental leave, the possibility of flexible and part time working arrangements, a parental and aged care support program, dual career hire programs, ANU school holiday programs, and childcare facilities on campus.

We are also Australia's representative at the World Meteorological Organisation and related international meteorological treaties and agreements. Position Overview   About the Bureau The Bureau of Meteorology is an agency in the Environment portfolio of the Australian Government. As Australia’s national weather, climate and water agency, the Bureau’s expertise and services assists Australians in preparing for, and responding to the harsh realities of their natural environment. Through regular forecasts, warnings, monitoring and advice spanning the Australian region and Antarctic Territory, the Bureau provides one of the most fundamental and widely used public services. About the Public Services Transformation Program The Bureau has embarked on a Public Services Transformation Program that will establish a fully integrated national approach to delivering meteorological, hydrological, climatological, and communication services. A national production capability will be augmented by enhanced environmental prediction domain specialities, and the insight and wisdom of local experts in our State and Territory offices. The new approach will provide a stronger connection to our customers at local and regional levels. This approach will significantly enhance the investment the 2  Position No. 15831 & 15832 Job Description   organisation makes in the development and training of its staff and the Program will be designed, developed, and deployed in consultation with staff, customers, partners and stakeholders. This program will see the Bureau increasing its overall investment in our public services and our staff and will help us deliver on our goals that underpin the Bureau's Strategy 2017-22: contributing to zero lives lost due to natural hazards and to an added $2 billion in added social and economic value for Australia by 2022. The transformation will deliver outcomes in three areas including: Provide customers with an outstanding experience every time they engage with the Bureau; Deliver products and services that provide the highest impact and value for the Australian community; and Ensure the Bureau's operations are resilient and sustainable.

Our researchers have made important advances in fundamental neuroscience and in diseases such as ageing dementia, schizophrenia and motor neurone disease.  Neural Migration Laboratory The Neural Migration Laboratory is headed by Professor Helen Cooper. Professor Cooper’s research focuses on the molecular signaling systems (guidance receptors and their ligands) governing neural stem cell activity, neuronal differentiation and axon pathfinding in the embryonic brain. A major research theme, and the focus of this position, is understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning synapse formation and synaptic activity. The goal of the Cooper laboratory is to identify the molecular mechanisms contributing to cortical malformations and neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. To address these questions the laboratory uses developmental mouse models, in vitro culture systems and state-of-the-art molecular and imaging approaches, including super-resolution microscopy.  About This Opportunity  Abnormal synapse formation leads to diminished synaptic transmission and impaired cognitive function. Delineating the molecular pathways that govern synaptic connectivity will not only provide key insights into the fundamental principles guiding the establishment of complex neural circuits, but will also shed light on the aberrant processes contributing to autism and schizophrenia. This project will investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating synapse formation. The incumbent will be responsible for experimental design, data analyses, and manuscript preparation, and will also be expected to apply for both independent and collaborative funding to support their research focus.  This position is located at our picturesque St Lucia campus, renowned as one of Australia’s most attractive university campuses, and located just 7km from Brisbane’s city centre.

The research team is led by recognised experts in their respective fields, who are committed to developing the careers of early-career researchers and engineers.  For more information about the School, please visit: http://www.mechmining.uq.edu.au/  UQ Centre of Hypersonics  UQ Centre of Hypersonics is globally recognised as the leading university-based hypersonics research group.  Our researchers, as well as our research programs have been recognised for their sustained, outstanding contributions and achievements in the advancement of atmospheric, hypersonic flight and related technologies for the past 20 years. We are internationally renowned for excellence and innovation, and have active collaborations with international universities and research groups, including those in France, Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan and India.  About This Opportunity  UQ’s Centre for Hypersonics has four PhD scholarship top-ups available for collaborative projects with the Defence Science and Technology Group (DST Group). The projects, detailed below, will be co-supervised by a DST scientist. The student will be based at UQ St Lucia, but will conduct their experiments at X3's new location with DST Group at Eaglefarm with DST technical support.  Projects 1 & 2: Radiation signatures  Supervisors: Professor Richard Morgan (principal) and Associate Professor Tim McIntyre (associate)  The radiation trails left behind in the shock layers and wakes of hypersonic flight vehicles are important foot prints which enable identification of the altitude, location, and direction of the vehicle, and may also be used to indicate something about their design and purpose. They may be created from radiating high temperature shock layers, and can be significantly enhanced by hot ablative products from TPS insulation and by combustion products from air breathing and rocket propelled systems.  Prediction techniques are not currently well advanced, and more experimental data and fundamental studies are needed to be able to confidently categorise and predict the signatures of specific vehicle configurations over their operational envelopes. The requirements for experimental studies include advanced hypersonic test facilities, the ability to create the associated sources of ablative and combustion products, and the instrumentation required to track the propagation and spectral intensity of radiating products in a hypersonic flowfield. The laboratories of UQ and DST are well suited to perform such a study, and have extensive expertise in the related diagnostics and instrumentation.  Project 1: The purpose of this proposed project is to perform a series of experimental investigations into these effects, focussing on ablation-driven radiating wakes.  Project 2: The purpose of this proposed project is to perform a series of experimental investigations into these effects, focussing on wake signatures produced by propulsion systems.  Interested in these projects? Read more about Professor Richard Morgan, and Associate Professor Tim McIntyre. To discuss these projects, please email Associate Professor McIntyre.  Project 3: High altitude Earth re-entry testing in a large scale expansion tube  Supervisor: Dr David Gildfind  A manned mission to Mars will see the fastest ever spacecraft return to Earth, up to 13 km/s. The engineering challenges of Earth re-entry at these speeds are still to be overcome, and suitable wind tunnel testing capabilities will be essential to fully understand the flow physics and to test new technologies at these speeds. One promising technology is magnetohydrodynamic aerobraking, which can potentially use the interaction between a magnetic field and the hot plasma enveloping the spacecraft to dissipate the spacecraft's immense kinetic energy when it first reaches the atmosphere, when speeds are a maximum but density is low enough to make heating manageable.  Australia is currently a world leader in aerodynamic ground testing of planetary entry flows, and its X2 and X3 facilities are routinely used to study Earth re-entry flows up to 11 km/s. However, neither facility can currently generate the low density part of superorbital flows associated with ambitious future missions such as deep space return from Mars or the Gas Giants. This project involves extending the test capability for X3 - the world's largest free-piston driven expansion tube - to make this testing possible.  The PhD will address several technical challenges which currently prevent this performance. X3's free-piston driver is currently limited by its piston mass; its current lightest piston, which has been structurally optimised for CNC machining from aluminium, weighs 100kg, but for these test flows the piston needs to be much lighter. This can only be achieved through structural optimisation using new manufacturing techniques such as additive manufacturing.  Control of piston dynamics becomes increasingly difficult as mass is reduced and acceleration increases. This PhD will develop an accelerometer diagnostics package to measure piston trajectory and thereby guide the development of new driver operating conditions. A recent prototype device has demonstrated proof-of-concept up to 2000g peak acceleration for this application; this PhD must extend this performance to 20,000g, and will examine how additional diagnostics can be integrated into the device.  Model size must be maximised, which is achieved with a nozzle expansion to the test section. However, X3's existing nozzles have not been developed for such high speeds and low densities, and a new nozzle will also be necessary to achieve the new testing capability. This capability will be verified through numerical analysis and finally experimental testing. The outcome of this project will be the world's highest performance superorbital aerodynamic test capability for deep space return re-entry.  Interested? Read more about Dr David Gildfind, or email him about this project.  Project 4: Development of high performance shock tube conditions  Supervisor: Professor Richard Morgan  The performance of high speed shock tunnels is limited by the constraints of speed, pressure, length scale, and the required test flow duration. Related to this is the scope and scale of experiments which can be performed in the facilities. Recent modifications to the X3 facility at UQ have led to new test conditions in the reflected shock tunnel mode which enable steady flow durations of the order of 10 ms to be reached with an 800 mm nozzle exit. This new operating mode, known as X3R, is currently limited to total pressures of the order of 10 MPa at Mach 7 with a 560 kg piston. This envelope can potentially be stretched to total pressures of 40 MPa and enthalpies up to the order of 6 km/s, at the expense of test time, by using lighter pistons. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the full potential operating envelope of the facility, and establish a range of calibrated operating conditions which will greatly extend our capability to do useful hypersonics research. Honours Graduates from Engineering, the Physical Sciences and Applied Mathematics all have potentially suitable backgrounds for this project. There will be a strong experimental component to the work, and students will need to have good analytical and numerical skills.  Interested?

At one of Australia’s largest emergency hospitals, we currently need part time and full time Emergency and Critical Care Veterinarians with a difference to join our growing team and save lives! We are looking for enthusiastic, energetic, intelligent and compassionate veterinarians who view being a vet as a calling and not just a career. If you have an energetic, positive outlook, work best under pressure and think fast in times of emergency, then you be the person we are looking for. At our hospital, you will be a true diagnostician, solving challenging medical problems and making life saving decisions for your patients. We need emergency vets who are genuinely interested in learning about all aspects of veterinary science as our field covers all disciplines. What we do here is important and makes a real difference to the lives of our patients and their owners. Our main focus is optimal patient care and having a happy hospital team. You’ll be providing patients with the highest standards of care and feel confident that you are doing the best for people’s pets but must be able to recognise that when financial limitations are present, a live pet is more important than a perfect diagnosis. We are committed to finding the right team to staff our hospital over the long term. We are looking for dedicated veterinarians who understand that being an emergency and critical care vet isn’t a 9-5 job and that shifts may run over time by several hours depending upon case load. You must be able to multitask and consistently provide high quality patient care in a sometimes hectic environment. You will need to be emotionally resilient and able to accept feedback on your case management and view it as a positive learning experience rather than a personal criticism. You must be able to work independently but also realise when it may benefit your patient to request help from a more experienced or specialist veterinarian. You need to have at least 1 year of general practice experience to apply for a junior position and at least 4-5 years of experience and membership or Fellowship qualifications from the Australian and New Zealand College of Veterinary Scientists or be a Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care for more senior positions. All non-specialist positions have a requirement to work overnight shifts on a shared roster. Previous experience in emergency and critical care is an advantage however your approach is the most important thing to us. If you have the right attitude and desire for Emergency and Critical Care but lack experience we can provide you with training, continuing education and workplace support. Our pay structure reflects your skills and knowledge. We actively support our staff in continuing education, including distance education courses, international conferences and membership examinations. Our veterinarians pay rate increases with their level of education, membership qualifications and abilities. You must be registered or have the necessary qualifications to be able to be registered with the Veterinary Surgeons’ Board of Western Australia.  Please only apply if you are happy to work overnights, weekends and public holidays including Christmas and Easter on a shared roster. It is a requirement of this position that on overnight shifts, veterinarians are able to perform manual handling and lift heavy weights when required. Your work will include consulting, surgery and providing advice to local veterinarians and to pet owners, and monitoring emergency cases, critical care cases and in-hospital patients of the various specialists. You must be able to prioritise your workload yourself, be able to multitask without becoming stressed and keep meticulous records on the patients in your care. You must have empathy for local veterinarians and be able to provide them with non-judgmental advice as required as well as accepting that all veterinarians aim to do the best for all of their patients even if their treatment decisions may be different to yours. You’ll be working with a large team of veterinarians and highly skilled, supportive, and friendly nurses to facilitate patient care and deal with your patient’s problems rapidly and appropriately. You will need to encourage and support all staff in the team, especially junior or less experienced members whether they are nurses or vets and be able to work in a commonly hectic and stressful environment. If you yell, or scream at others when you are stressed, then please don’t apply. The team we have is calm under pressure and work well together because we avoid employing people who may increase their stress. Our emergency team likes to socializes together outside of work. You must be able to deal with the stress of clients and remain compassionate even if clients are upset with the situation they find themselves in. Additionally you must be emotionally flexible and able to rapidly shift from the long emotional support required for a patient being euthanized, to the demands of a critically traumatised patient which needs rapid treatment decisions to be made. The workload is heavy and demanding and when a rush of cases occurs it can feel overwhelming. There are no set meal breaks so you will often have to eat on the run and if you have time, you can have a coffee too. If you are the sort of person who always asks why, researches your cases to see how you could have done better and worries about your patients then you might be the sort of veterinarian who we are looking for. In return for your hard work and dedication, we will: Encourage and support your further education over the years Give you the training you need to develop your emergency and critical care skills Provide a healthy and happy workplace for you and everyone else Acknowledge you need work-life balance Deal with negative workplace behaviour to make sure you enjoy working here with us Provide you with a challenging and satisfying career Provide all the equipment you require to optimally care for your patients Genuinely care about you as a member of the family and respect your opinion on how we can be improved Provide chocolate Tim Tams and M&M’s on request. Celebrate your birthday Annual salary ranges from $54,000 to $120,000 commensurate with experience and qualifications. Emergency, critical care and specialty veterinary medicine isn’t for everyone. To take on this job you need: perseverance, a belief that miracles are possible (they are), a healthy dose of pragmatism and the ability to pro-actively think ahead for your patient’s requirements. But, the rewards can be amazing! You will love the team and get a real buzz from working with us. We take recruitment very seriously because we know it is important to get the right people and it’s also important that you are going to like working with us. We want to build up a team of people who will stay for years, be part of the our family, and grow with us. So if you have made it to the bottom of this job ad then you may be the person we are looking for. We are looking forward to hearing from you.","Full-time, Part-time",30+ days ago
