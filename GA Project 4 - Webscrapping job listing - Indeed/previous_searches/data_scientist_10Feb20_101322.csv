Connected creativity is the synchronization of strategic positioning, engaging creative, combined with the next generation of engagement planning to ensure ideas create the cut-through needed to deliver the strongest commercial performances. Today, creativity cannot be left to chance. One brand expression or big TV ad is simply not enough. More than ever, brands need to live in culture and our consumers worlds, allowing audiences to not only consume brands, but take part in owning, creating and amplifying them. To do this, the role of influencers, publishers, the news and bought media are inseparable from each other and the expression of the idea itself. To create such work, the classic disciplines of the marketing mix – advertising, experience, PR, CRM, media, digital – must all be unified, removing P&Ls, biases and incumbency to reveal a new breed of agnostic agency, resulting in connected creativity. At CHE Proximity, we see this as the shift from brand as advertising to brand as experience. It is as profound a change in advertising as the printing press was to the democratisation of information. We are investing our every effort into leading this transformation and in doing so, supporting the sustainability of our cherished industry as an essential ingredient of modern commerce. This is what we call Connected Creativity.

We are Australia's national weather, climate and water agency, in the Environment and Energy portfolio of the Australian Government, operating under the authority of the Meteorology Act 1955 and the Water Act 2007. We have expertise and services to help Australian prepare and respond to the realities of their natural environment, including droughts, floods, fires, storms, tsunami and tropical cyclones. Our products and services include observations, forecasts, analysis and advice covering Australia's atmosphere, water, oceans and space environments. We also undertake scientific research in support of our operations and services. Through regular forecasts, warnings, monitoring and advice, we provide one of Australia's most fundamental and widely-used public services. Our employees and contractors work across Australia and remote islands, providing services from the Antarctic to beyond the equator, and from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific. We have strong relationships with our customers and partners, including the aviation, agriculture, energy and resources, national security and emergency services sectors, as well as international science and meteorological agencies, State and Local governments and the Australian community. We are also Australia's representative at the World Meteorological Organisation and related international meteorological treaties and agreements. Position Overview   About the Bureau The Bureau of Meteorology is an agency in the Environment portfolio of the Australian Government. As Australia’s national weather, climate and water agency, the Bureau’s expertise and services assists Australians in preparing for, and responding to the harsh realities of their natural environment. Through regular forecasts, warnings, monitoring and advice spanning the Australian region and Antarctic Territory, the Bureau provides one of the most fundamental and widely used public services. About the Public Services Transformation Program The Bureau has embarked on a Public Services Transformation Program that will establish a fully integrated national approach to delivering meteorological, hydrological, climatological, and communication services. A national production capability will be augmented by enhanced environmental prediction domain specialities, and the insight and wisdom of local experts in our State and Territory offices. The new approach will provide a stronger connection to our customers at local and regional levels. This approach will significantly enhance the investment the 2  Position No. 15831 & 15832 Job Description   organisation makes in the development and training of its staff and the Program will be designed, developed, and deployed in consultation with staff, customers, partners and stakeholders.

They use Culture Amp every day to make their workplaces better, along with over 2,500 other companies from around the globe, making up a community who stand together to improve the world of work.  With offices in Melbourne, San Francisco, New York, and London, Culture Amp isn’t just for fast-growing startups - we’re for every organization that wants to put culture first. By making it easy to collect, understand and act on employee feedback, we enable People teams to make better decisions, demonstrate impact, and turn company culture into a competitive edge.  It’s what makes us the world’s leading people & culture platform.  The Opportunity at Culture Amp  Culture Amp is seeking a Director of Machine Learning to lead our machine learning engineering team. This is an exciting opportunity to work with some of the best minds on complex problems in the area of natural language processing (NLP), recommendations and foresight prediction.  As the first and largest people & culture platform we have more and better structured data than anyone in the employee feedback space. We already collect data from millions of employees across thousands of customers and many more in our People Geek community. We have leveraged that data to draw important insights for our customers to help them create better places to work. For Culture Amp machine learning plays a crucial and increasing role in helping our customers realise meaningful insights from our data moat. We continue to be committed to leveraging cutting edge techniques to uncover and communicate ever deeper insights and help our customers drive meaningful change.  Leading both people and the machine learning technology vision, this role will help us deliver numerous features that will have a significant impact for our customers.  Examples of where machine learning can help us unlock more value:  What are employees talking about? Negatively? Positively? Which cohort of employees are most at risk of leaving? What bias’ exist when giving feedback? What actions are most effective for companies like yours? What are the early indicators that somebody needs support to continue to be high performing?  Responsibilities include:  Hiring and leading all our machine learning engineers Shape the machine learning road map Work with product managers to deliver world-first features Strategically position Culture Amp for future success in machine learning Educate and train others in the business about where machine learning could have a big impact  What you bring to our camp  You will help shape the future of ML at Culture Amp through guiding the development of the next round of machine learning features. You will guide features from conception through to implementation, by helping to identify the right features to build, and making sure we have the people and expertise to prototype and build them.  The conception phase starts with conversations with product managers and other stakeholders. Product managers are well placed to know what some of the customer problems are, but you will need to provide guidance on which of those problems ML can help with, and maybe find new opportunities which have not yet been considered.  You will need to have enough experience with machine learning to evaluate both the benefits and risks of any particular machine learning project. Does the customer value, justify the delivery effort and its associated uncertainty? And will the risks of developing an ML solution be acceptable? What level of accuracy is acceptable for this feature? You will need to be able to communicate this kind of information effectively with colleagues, product managers, people scientists, tech leads and delivery leads, who may not be aware of the technical details of machine learning.  During development you will need to know how to plan and scope, at a high level, the steps needed to implement an ML solution to a customer problem. From:  mapping the problem to something solvable with machine learning prototyping possible solutions creating necessary production services and integrating with the product to bring it to customers delegating the details of this work to other ML engineers as appropriate  To achieve this, you will need to have broad knowledge of and experience with a wide range of ML algorithms and techniques (including traditional supervised learning,deep learning and unsupervised methods) and the tradeoffs of each as well as evaluation methodologies. You will also need a sound knowledge of the best practices for the production of ML projects, including how and when to annotate data to ensure system accuracy and provide training material, and knowledge of how to best leverage third-party data sources even when they do not match the domain perfectly (eg through techniques such as transfer learning). As we deal extensively with textual data, you will ideally have knowledge of natural language processing techniques.  You will also need to make sure the ML Engineers in the practice are set up for success to help achieve these goals. This includes making sure that we have the right people, that they are working in the appropriate parts of the company, and that they have the skills necessary for a particular project. You may need to upskill less experienced engineers on particular facets of machine learning as necessary.  What We Offer  You’ll be supported as you develop in your role and have access to great benefits such as our ‘Coaching for Everyone’ and ‘Learn Yourself Up’ programs. You’ll also receive a competitive package plus generous stock options, flexible working and other benefits.

Connected creativity is the synchronization of strategic positioning, engaging creative, combined with the next generation of engagement planning to ensure ideas create the cut-through needed to deliver the strongest commercial performances. Today, creativity cannot be left to chance. One brand expression or big TV ad is simply not enough. More than ever, brands need to live in culture and our consumers worlds, allowing audiences to not only consume brands, but take part in owning, creating and amplifying them. To do this, the role of influencers, publishers, the news and bought media are inseparable from each other and the expression of the idea itself.

Who is CHE Proximity More than ever before the medium, the message and it's sequencing are inseparable from each other. ‘Unlike any time in history, connecting the medium, the message, and its sequencing to the consumer is more vital than ever. Connected creativity is the synchronization of strategic positioning, engaging creative, combined with the next generation of engagement planning to ensure ideas create the cut-through needed to deliver the strongest commercial performances. Today, creativity cannot be left to chance. One brand expression or big TV ad is simply not enough. More than ever, brands need to live in culture and our consumers worlds, allowing audiences to not only consume brands, but take part in owning, creating and amplifying them. To do this, the role of influencers, publishers, the news and bought media are inseparable from each other and the expression of the idea itself. To create such work, the classic disciplines of the marketing mix – advertising, experience, PR, CRM, media, digital – must all be unified, removing P&Ls, biases and incumbency to reveal a new breed of agnostic agency, resulting in connected creativity. At CHE Proximity, we see this as the shift from brand as advertising to brand as experience. It is as profound a change in advertising as the printing press was to the democratisation of information. We are investing our every effort into leading this transformation and in doing so, supporting the sustainability of our cherished industry as an essential ingredient of modern commerce. This is what we call Connected Creativity.

When we bought media in-house we didn't put it in a corner, instead we centralized it in the strategic planning department, within experience. Why? Because we believe experience starts with the very first exposure to a brand and so bought and owned channels should be planned together across the entire experience. Our approach is driven by data and technology. Data is a huge part of what we do as an agency and media, particularly programmatic, is no different. We're fortunate to have some excellent data scientists working with us helping to build the latest and greatest in models.

Connected creativity is the synchronization of strategic positioning, engaging creative, combined with the next generation of engagement planning to ensure ideas create the cut-through needed to deliver the strongest commercial performances. Today, creativity cannot be left to chance. One brand expression or big TV ad is simply not enough. More than ever, brands need to live in culture and our consumers worlds, allowing audiences to not only consume brands, but take part in owning, creating and amplifying them. To do this, the role of influencers, publishers, the news and bought media are inseparable from each other and the expression of the idea itself. To create such work, the classic disciplines of the marketing mix – advertising, experience, PR, CRM, media, digital – must all be unified, removing P&Ls, biases and incumbency to reveal a new breed of agnostic agency, resulting in connected creativity. At CHE Proximity, we see this as the shift from brand as advertising to brand as experience. It is as profound a change in advertising as the printing press was to the democratisation of information. We are investing our every effort into leading this transformation and in doing so, supporting the sustainability of our cherished industry as an essential ingredient of modern commerce. This is what we call Connected Creativity.

Boasting strong student enrolments in professionally accredited programs, combined with world-class researchers and facilities, we are focused on strengthening our position in the engineering community. We will develop global solutions to contemporary issues and mentor the leaders of tomorrow by attracting the brightest minds and fostering a truly innovative and collaborative work environment.  The School is undertaking pioneering research in the area of poroelastic rock mechanics to support the resources industries of the future. Areas of focus include the development of advanced rock preconditioning and fragmentation techniques to support the extraction of future mineral resources, and the sustainable enhancement of unconventional gas from coal seams. A strong industry funded research program has been secured, including all of the resources required to create a paradigm shift in these strategically important industries, both within Australia and overseas. The research team is led by recognised experts in their respective fields, who are committed to developing the careers of early-career researchers and engineers.  For more information about the School, please visit: http://www.mechmining.uq.edu.au/  UQ Centre of Hypersonics  UQ Centre of Hypersonics is globally recognised as the leading university-based hypersonics research group.  Our researchers, as well as our research programs have been recognised for their sustained, outstanding contributions and achievements in the advancement of atmospheric, hypersonic flight and related technologies for the past 20 years. We are internationally renowned for excellence and innovation, and have active collaborations with international universities and research groups, including those in France, Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan and India.  About This Opportunity  UQ’s Centre for Hypersonics has four PhD scholarship top-ups available for collaborative projects with the Defence Science and Technology Group (DST Group). The projects, detailed below, will be co-supervised by a DST scientist. The student will be based at UQ St Lucia, but will conduct their experiments at X3's new location with DST Group at Eaglefarm with DST technical support.  Projects 1 & 2: Radiation signatures  Supervisors: Professor Richard Morgan (principal) and Associate Professor Tim McIntyre (associate)  The radiation trails left behind in the shock layers and wakes of hypersonic flight vehicles are important foot prints which enable identification of the altitude, location, and direction of the vehicle, and may also be used to indicate something about their design and purpose. They may be created from radiating high temperature shock layers, and can be significantly enhanced by hot ablative products from TPS insulation and by combustion products from air breathing and rocket propelled systems.  Prediction techniques are not currently well advanced, and more experimental data and fundamental studies are needed to be able to confidently categorise and predict the signatures of specific vehicle configurations over their operational envelopes. The requirements for experimental studies include advanced hypersonic test facilities, the ability to create the associated sources of ablative and combustion products, and the instrumentation required to track the propagation and spectral intensity of radiating products in a hypersonic flowfield. The laboratories of UQ and DST are well suited to perform such a study, and have extensive expertise in the related diagnostics and instrumentation.  Project 1: The purpose of this proposed project is to perform a series of experimental investigations into these effects, focussing on ablation-driven radiating wakes.  Project 2: The purpose of this proposed project is to perform a series of experimental investigations into these effects, focussing on wake signatures produced by propulsion systems.  Interested in these projects? Read more about Professor Richard Morgan, and Associate Professor Tim McIntyre. To discuss these projects, please email Associate Professor McIntyre.  Project 3: High altitude Earth re-entry testing in a large scale expansion tube  Supervisor: Dr David Gildfind  A manned mission to Mars will see the fastest ever spacecraft return to Earth, up to 13 km/s. The engineering challenges of Earth re-entry at these speeds are still to be overcome, and suitable wind tunnel testing capabilities will be essential to fully understand the flow physics and to test new technologies at these speeds. One promising technology is magnetohydrodynamic aerobraking, which can potentially use the interaction between a magnetic field and the hot plasma enveloping the spacecraft to dissipate the spacecraft's immense kinetic energy when it first reaches the atmosphere, when speeds are a maximum but density is low enough to make heating manageable.  Australia is currently a world leader in aerodynamic ground testing of planetary entry flows, and its X2 and X3 facilities are routinely used to study Earth re-entry flows up to 11 km/s. However, neither facility can currently generate the low density part of superorbital flows associated with ambitious future missions such as deep space return from Mars or the Gas Giants. This project involves extending the test capability for X3 - the world's largest free-piston driven expansion tube - to make this testing possible.  The PhD will address several technical challenges which currently prevent this performance. X3's free-piston driver is currently limited by its piston mass; its current lightest piston, which has been structurally optimised for CNC machining from aluminium, weighs 100kg, but for these test flows the piston needs to be much lighter. This can only be achieved through structural optimisation using new manufacturing techniques such as additive manufacturing.  Control of piston dynamics becomes increasingly difficult as mass is reduced and acceleration increases. This PhD will develop an accelerometer diagnostics package to measure piston trajectory and thereby guide the development of new driver operating conditions. A recent prototype device has demonstrated proof-of-concept up to 2000g peak acceleration for this application; this PhD must extend this performance to 20,000g, and will examine how additional diagnostics can be integrated into the device.  Model size must be maximised, which is achieved with a nozzle expansion to the test section. However, X3's existing nozzles have not been developed for such high speeds and low densities, and a new nozzle will also be necessary to achieve the new testing capability. This capability will be verified through numerical analysis and finally experimental testing. The outcome of this project will be the world's highest performance superorbital aerodynamic test capability for deep space return re-entry.  Interested? Read more about Dr David Gildfind, or email him about this project.  Project 4: Development of high performance shock tube conditions  Supervisor: Professor Richard Morgan  The performance of high speed shock tunnels is limited by the constraints of speed, pressure, length scale, and the required test flow duration. Related to this is the scope and scale of experiments which can be performed in the facilities. Recent modifications to the X3 facility at UQ have led to new test conditions in the reflected shock tunnel mode which enable steady flow durations of the order of 10 ms to be reached with an 800 mm nozzle exit. This new operating mode, known as X3R, is currently limited to total pressures of the order of 10 MPa at Mach 7 with a 560 kg piston. This envelope can potentially be stretched to total pressures of 40 MPa and enthalpies up to the order of 6 km/s, at the expense of test time, by using lighter pistons. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the full potential operating envelope of the facility, and establish a range of calibrated operating conditions which will greatly extend our capability to do useful hypersonics research. Honours Graduates from Engineering, the Physical Sciences and Applied Mathematics all have potentially suitable backgrounds for this project. There will be a strong experimental component to the work, and students will need to have good analytical and numerical skills.  Interested? Read more about Professor Richard Morgan, or email him about this project.

When we bought media in-house we didn't put it in a corner, instead we centralized it in the strategic planning department, within experience. Why? Because we believe experience starts with the very first exposure to a brand and so bought and owned channels should be planned together across the entire experience. Our approach is driven by data and technology. Data is a huge part of what we do as an agency and media, particularly programmatic, is no different. We're fortunate to have some excellent data scientists working with us helping to build the latest and greatest in models. From a technology point of view, we're bringing adtech and martech together and have a team of developers enabling this. You'll also be surrounded by brand and innovation planners, a UX team and Creative Directors who are all incredibly excited about this new offering. Our client base has grown rapidly and is continuing on this upward trajectory. All of our clients are looking for fresh thinking in media. They cover a range of industries across education, energy, health and other service providers.  Responsibilities   Delivering addressable recommendations across Paid Social and/or Programmatic for clients which generate real business outcomes. Mentoring and training the team to be able to help implement these solutions. Leading relationships with media and data partners ensuring access of new innovations to CHEP clients. Leading optimizations throughout the campaign. Guiding the team to deliver solutions for today, as well as exploring new and innovative solutions for tomorrow. Working with the planning team on recommendations and the reporting team on data insights. It's worth noting that all of our planning is agnostic and we work as one team so you won't be fighting to get programmatic ‘heard'. Working with other departments in the agency to solve client's business problems. Helping to educate the wider agency and other departments.  Desired Skills and Experience   A strong history of working in paid social and/or programmatic, across leading accounts. The ability to deliver recommendations on additional partners and platforms. Intelligent use of data in client recommendations. Knows how to extract useful insights from data. The ability to lead relationships with key media partners for the agency. The ability to mentor and lead a team. The ability to lead the training of other members of the media team and working to promote cross skilling. Experience with DMP's will be preferred, particularly Adobe Audience Manager.  Who is CHE Proximity More than ever before the medium, the message and it's sequencing are inseparable from each other. ‘Unlike any time in history, connecting the medium, the message, and its sequencing to the consumer is more vital than ever. Connected creativity is the synchronization of strategic positioning, engaging creative, combined with the next generation of engagement planning to ensure ideas create the cut-through needed to deliver the strongest commercial performances. Today, creativity cannot be left to chance. One brand expression or big TV ad is simply not enough. More than ever, brands need to live in culture and our consumers worlds, allowing audiences to not only consume brands, but take part in owning, creating and amplifying them. To do this, the role of influencers, publishers, the news and bought media are inseparable from each other and the expression of the idea itself. To create such work, the classic disciplines of the marketing mix – advertising, experience, PR, CRM, media, digital – must all be unified, removing P&Ls, biases and incumbency to reveal a new breed of agnostic agency, resulting in connected creativity. At CHE Proximity, we see this as the shift from brand as advertising to brand as experience. It is as profound a change in advertising as the printing press was to the democratisation of information. We are investing our every effort into leading this transformation and in doing so, supporting the sustainability of our cherished industry as an essential ingredient of modern commerce. This is what we call Connected Creativity.  Some recent highlights In addition to growing our business with high profile and forward-thinking clients our creativity and effectiveness has been recognised by our peers: B&T 2019: VIC & Direct Response/Performance Agency of the Year London International Awards 2019: APAC Agency of the Year Tangrams: Asia Effectiveness Agency of the Year 2018, 2019 AFR Most Innovative Companies 2019: Best Marketing Innovation 2017, 2018, 2019 Mumbrella 2019: Creative Agency of the Year, Award for Data Driven Marketing WARC 2019: Most Effective Agency, Australia and New Zealand WARC: Most Effective Australian Agency 2014 2019 Cannes 2019: 2 Silver, 2 Bronze & 7 Finalists Contagious Pioneers 2019: placed 5th The Drum's Big Won Report 2018: 9th Most Creative Agency in the World Australian Effie Awards 2018: Agency of the Year Adnews 2018: Australian, Victorian & Customer Experience Agency of the Year Adobe Innovation Award 2018: Data-Driven Marketing Implementation & Multi-Solution Implementation  The Clemenger Group supports an inclusive workplace and welcomes applicants from diverse backgrounds.

Our researchers have made important advances in fundamental neuroscience and in diseases such as ageing dementia, schizophrenia and motor neurone disease.  Neural Migration Laboratory The Neural Migration Laboratory is headed by Professor Helen Cooper. Professor Cooper’s research focuses on the molecular signaling systems (guidance receptors and their ligands) governing neural stem cell activity, neuronal differentiation and axon pathfinding in the embryonic brain. A major research theme, and the focus of this position, is understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning synapse formation and synaptic activity. The goal of the Cooper laboratory is to identify the molecular mechanisms contributing to cortical malformations and neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. To address these questions the laboratory uses developmental mouse models, in vitro culture systems and state-of-the-art molecular and imaging approaches, including super-resolution microscopy.  About This Opportunity  Abnormal synapse formation leads to diminished synaptic transmission and impaired cognitive function. Delineating the molecular pathways that govern synaptic connectivity will not only provide key insights into the fundamental principles guiding the establishment of complex neural circuits, but will also shed light on the aberrant processes contributing to autism and schizophrenia. This project will investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating synapse formation. The incumbent will be responsible for experimental design, data analyses, and manuscript preparation, and will also be expected to apply for both independent and collaborative funding to support their research focus.  This position is located at our picturesque St Lucia campus, renowned as one of Australia’s most attractive university campuses, and located just 7km from Brisbane’s city centre.

You will be able to interpret experimental data to plan subsequent experiments and troubleshoot techniques. In addition, you will be able to work independently, managing your time across conflicting demands whilst maintaining a high level of accuracy.

Our expertise in delivering highly complex data decisions based on our algorithmic and data capability. While this has been a core strength of ours since our inception, we have recently started investing in the look, feel and interaction our clients experience when using our products.  Part of this is building out a UI development capability. Working with Ben Buchanan (our Design Engineering Lead) we’re looking for someone with a passion for that intersection of design and engineering to come in and help, among other things, build our design framework and UI library, Qbit.  Role Details/FAQ:  What is it I’ll be working on?  The role will focus heavily on Quantium's UI library Qbit, which is framework-agnostic and currently supports React and Angular. Other work will include UI development in a range of cross-product work; and there are opportunities to work cross-stack into the application backend and endpoint design. Who can I expect to work with?  We work in multi-discipline teams so you’ll be working alongside Data Scientists, Analysts, Testers and platform engineers, depending on the project. This role sits on Quantium's cross-product Core Team, which is responsible for enabling quality engineering at scale; and will be working regularly with the Design team, responsible for the Quantium Design System (QDS).  What are we looking for in the ideal candidate?  Firstly, you can be anybody, from any walk of life. Before we get to your skills we want you to know that we actively try to foster an environment where all our employees feel safe, welcomed and celebrated. We look for the same in all people we hire  You will be currently working on a range of front end engineering and design components at scale. We’re not really fussed which JS framework you’re working with, so long as you don’t think it’s the only one worth using, core JS skills are more important. You will also consider CSS to be one of your primary skills, despairing when you hear “engineers” disparage the skill and talent it takes to build stacking content. HTML is an art as far as you’re concerned.  As time goes on, we don’t want to restrict you to just front end so you’ll also be keen to pick up some C#, while retaining your UI expertise.  This role is open to candidates who are already cross-stack; and also to strong UI developers who are keen to grow their backend skills.  Do you have a bullet point checklist for me to check off my suitability?  We know people are not bullet points but sure thing!  You have:  Lots of experience in interface development at scale, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and accessibility Experience working with component-driven UI (ideally using in-house UI libraries) Experience working with UI frameworks (eg. React, Angular) Experience working with typed JavaScript variants (eg. Flow, Typescript) An awareness of DevOps and an appetite to contribute to effective CI/CD pipelines Experience working with a .NET/C# backend is ideal but not required A love for knowledge sharing, you know what works, but you’re also happy to learn new methods and technology  Ok, the work sounds great, but what’s in it for me?  Quantium takes care of its biggest asset – our people. We believe there is more to a successful career than just hard work. To this end we provide a range of personal and professional benefits across six broad categories:  Career Our exceptional growth means new and exciting career opportunities at Quantium. New clients, new projects or new roles – our growth plans power bigger and better career possibilities for our people.  Workplace We work hard but we don’t take ourselves too seriously – ask anyone who has been on one of our annual trips away!

Financial We offer a market leading range of financial and insurance benefits and entitlements.  Health and wellbeing Healthy body, healthy mind. Quantium believes in promoting ways for you to maintain and improve your health and personal wellbeing. Our team enjoys a range of activities, including group fitness sessions, yoga, health advice and various team sports  Lifestyle We recognise the need to balance personal and family commitments with your work. At Quantium you have more control over how, when and where you work. We also recognise the importance of holidays and time to recharge so we always do our best to accommodate leave requests.  Family Quantium understands that family is important. We support the needs and career aspirations of our colleagues with families.

Times and technology have changed, but this remains our goal. Instead of wrangling single, SQL-based databases and ASP.net web applications, our MapR Hadoop platform runs across 200 nodes with multiple clusters and .net APIs and react.js/Angular 1&2 web products plugging in. Our Hybrid on-prem/cloud platform is also coming along nicely.  Our industry-leading partners’ real-world data sets and SAAS product requirements are growing along with their complexity so we need to adapt our ways of working to allow for better CI/CD pipelines, performance, availability and all the rest of the “Devops” buzzwords. We need someone to lead the charge. We’re hoping that’s you.  Our Platform Team have done a wonderful job in providing as much support to our product focused engineering teams, but with some serious infrastructure initiatives underway, they need to focus on that area, while allowing for a team to allow us to deploy at scale.  This role is pivotal for Quantium to deploy and grow its machine learning product capability both in the local market and overseas by enabling effortless operation of the pipelines in hybrid environments.
