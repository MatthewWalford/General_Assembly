Formally employed on a two-year contract (with the possibility of extension conditional on funding) in the Department of Management and Marketing within the Faculty of Business and Economics at the University of Melbourne, the successful candidate will share responsibility for coding existing and new algorithms that characterize and test causality using methods from dynamical systems research in ecology and applied physics. In conjunction with Associate Professor Michael Zyphur (University of Melbourne), Associate Professor Jinjing Li (University of Canberra), and Professor George Sugihara (University of California, San Diego), this two-year position will give the incumbent an opportunity to learn and apply new skills to help revolutionize data analysis in the social and health sciences. Throughout the year some travel to Canberra is expected, and the Postdoctoral Fellow may even choose to be primarily located in Canberra to more closely collaborate with Associate Professor Jinjing Li if this is of interest.  The successful candidate will have a PhD in Computer Science or equivalent, with data science and/or software engineering expertise using Python and C. Experience with package development in R may be helpful but is not necessary. The project will primarily focus on scientific computing applications to evaluate complex dynamic systems on GPUs and massively distributed CPUs (e.g., AWS platforms such as Lambda or equivalent). For the GPU case, programming in the novel and intuitive ArrayFire library will allow compiling for CUDA and OpenCL (as well as Python/C for local parallel processing on multi-core CPUs). For distributed computing on cloud infrastructure, in-house development using Python and C will be required. We do not expect prior expertise in all APIs / languages that will be used for the project, but we do expect the qualified candidate to have a strong interest in learning and using the required APIs / languages as needed as well as the background required to do so.  Salary is generous at Level B (over $100k per annum) and generous discretionary spending for national and international conferences as well as hardware (including cloud computing time). With a focus on passion and innovation rather than typical forms of “office work”, the appointee will work alongside other programming experts and applied researchers seeking to revolutionize data analysis in the social and health sciences. Prospects for employment in academia and applied industries after the two-year Postdoctoral position are expected to be substantial.

We've built marketplaces where anyone can buy and sell the creative assets they need to complete their projects faster. Our community can now buy millions of different kinds of assets on Envato Market ( https://themeforest.net/ ), or subscribe to the #1 unlimited subscription service for creatives, Envato Elements ( https://elements.envato.com/ ).

Connected creativity is the synchronization of strategic positioning, engaging creative, combined with the next generation of engagement planning to ensure ideas create the cut-through needed to deliver the strongest commercial performances. Today, creativity cannot be left to chance. One brand expression or big TV ad is simply not enough. More than ever, brands need to live in culture and our consumers worlds, allowing audiences to not only consume brands, but take part in owning, creating and amplifying them. To do this, the role of influencers, publishers, the news and bought media are inseparable from each other and the expression of the idea itself. To create such work, the classic disciplines of the marketing mix – advertising, experience, PR, CRM, media, digital – must all be unified, removing P&Ls, biases and incumbency to reveal a new breed of agnostic agency, resulting in connected creativity. At CHE Proximity, we see this as the shift from brand as advertising to brand as experience. It is as profound a change in advertising as the printing press was to the democratisation of information. We are investing our every effort into leading this transformation and in doing so, supporting the sustainability of our cherished industry as an essential ingredient of modern commerce. This is what we call Connected Creativity.

They use Culture Amp every day to make their workplaces better, along with over 2,500 other companies from around the globe, making up a community who stand together to improve the world of work.  With offices in Melbourne, San Francisco, New York, and London, Culture Amp isn’t just for fast-growing startups - we’re for every organization that wants to put culture first. By making it easy to collect, understand and act on employee feedback, we enable People teams to make better decisions, demonstrate impact, and turn company culture into a competitive edge.  It’s what makes us the world’s leading people & culture platform.  The Opportunity at Culture Amp  Culture Amp is seeking a Director of Machine Learning to lead our machine learning engineering team. This is an exciting opportunity to work with some of the best minds on complex problems in the area of natural language processing (NLP), recommendations and foresight prediction.  As the first and largest people & culture platform we have more and better structured data than anyone in the employee feedback space. We already collect data from millions of employees across thousands of customers and many more in our People Geek community. We have leveraged that data to draw important insights for our customers to help them create better places to work. For Culture Amp machine learning plays a crucial and increasing role in helping our customers realise meaningful insights from our data moat. We continue to be committed to leveraging cutting edge techniques to uncover and communicate ever deeper insights and help our customers drive meaningful change.  Leading both people and the machine learning technology vision, this role will help us deliver numerous features that will have a significant impact for our customers.  Examples of where machine learning can help us unlock more value:  What are employees talking about? Negatively? Positively? Which cohort of employees are most at risk of leaving? What bias’ exist when giving feedback? What actions are most effective for companies like yours? What are the early indicators that somebody needs support to continue to be high performing?  Responsibilities include:  Hiring and leading all our machine learning engineers Shape the machine learning road map Work with product managers to deliver world-first features Strategically position Culture Amp for future success in machine learning Educate and train others in the business about where machine learning could have a big impact  What you bring to our camp  You will help shape the future of ML at Culture Amp through guiding the development of the next round of machine learning features. You will guide features from conception through to implementation, by helping to identify the right features to build, and making sure we have the people and expertise to prototype and build them.  The conception phase starts with conversations with product managers and other stakeholders. Product managers are well placed to know what some of the customer problems are, but you will need to provide guidance on which of those problems ML can help with, and maybe find new opportunities which have not yet been considered.  You will need to have enough experience with machine learning to evaluate both the benefits and risks of any particular machine learning project. Does the customer value, justify the delivery effort and its associated uncertainty? And will the risks of developing an ML solution be acceptable? What level of accuracy is acceptable for this feature? You will need to be able to communicate this kind of information effectively with colleagues, product managers, people scientists, tech leads and delivery leads, who may not be aware of the technical details of machine learning.  During development you will need to know how to plan and scope, at a high level, the steps needed to implement an ML solution to a customer problem. From:  mapping the problem to something solvable with machine learning prototyping possible solutions creating necessary production services and integrating with the product to bring it to customers delegating the details of this work to other ML engineers as appropriate  To achieve this, you will need to have broad knowledge of and experience with a wide range of ML algorithms and techniques (including traditional supervised learning,deep learning and unsupervised methods) and the tradeoffs of each as well as evaluation methodologies. You will also need a sound knowledge of the best practices for the production of ML projects, including how and when to annotate data to ensure system accuracy and provide training material, and knowledge of how to best leverage third-party data sources even when they do not match the domain perfectly (eg through techniques such as transfer learning). As we deal extensively with textual data, you will ideally have knowledge of natural language processing techniques.  You will also need to make sure the ML Engineers in the practice are set up for success to help achieve these goals. This includes making sure that we have the right people, that they are working in the appropriate parts of the company, and that they have the skills necessary for a particular project. You may need to upskill less experienced engineers on particular facets of machine learning as necessary.  What We Offer  You’ll be supported as you develop in your role and have access to great benefits such as our ‘Coaching for Everyone’ and ‘Learn Yourself Up’ programs.
